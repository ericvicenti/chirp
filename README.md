## About Chirp

Chirp was a weekend project to make a group iChat/Skype/Twitter clone based on twillio and socket.io for the browser.

A chat room is available in the browser, but if a user is not online, messages are sent out over SMS. Users can respond to the texts and chat in the room as themselves.
